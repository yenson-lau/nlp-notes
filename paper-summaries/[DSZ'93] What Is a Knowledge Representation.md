## Roles of a knowledge representation

The notion of a *knowledge representation* may be best described by its five roles:

1. It is most fundamentally a *surrogate*, i.e. a substitute for the thing it represents. It is used by an entity to determine consequences via thinking rather than acting.
2. It is a set of *ontological commitments*, i.e. the terms and clauses that I think about the world with.
3. It is a *fragmentary theory of reasoning*, expressed in terms of three components:
   1. the representation's fundamental conception of intelligent reasoning (i.e. its calculus);
   2. the set of inferences that the representation sanctions; and 
   3. the set of inferences that it recommends
4. It is a *medium for pragmatically efficient computation*, i.e. the computational environment on which thinking is accomplished.
   - The representation contributes to this by organising information to facilitate making recommended inferences
5. It is a medium of human expression; a language.



### Consequences of the roles and their diversity

1. Each role requires something slightly different from a representation, which leads to different sets of properties that we may want a representation to have.
2. The roles are believed to provide a framework for characterising a wide variety of representations, depending on how each representation views each role.
3. Previous disagreements about representation are usefully disentangled when all five roles are given appropriate consideration.
4. For research, this view of representations provides a broad perspective on what's important about a representation. For practice, it is a reminder about the inspirations and sources of power for a variety of representations.
